The backend of the project uses Django to integrate with the GitHub API, fetching and filtering user profiles and repository data to provide relevant information. RESTful endpoints are available for the React frontend to query user data based on GitHub usernames.

The React frontend features an input field for GitHub usernames and dynamically displays profiles and repositories in a clean layout. It uses React's state management for data handling and display.

Key features include real-time data fetching from the GitHub API and a responsive design for a seamless user experience across devices.
